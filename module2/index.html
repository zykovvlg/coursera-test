				<div class="title-box bg-color-26a9ff text-color-white">Beef</div>				
				<p>Beef according to this recipe turns out to be the softest, directly breaks down into separate fibers! Even very tough meat will melt in your mouth, if necessary, you need to increase the cooking time. When stewing, a delicious sauce is formed-a combination of onions, butter and meat juice. I recommend that you try this recipe, very, very soft and delicious meat turns out!</p>
